# Ember-wp-api

This project is intended as a basis for combining Ember as a frontend for a WordPress backend. I am thinking of using the frontend of Wordpress to serve to search engines to have a crawlable Ember application

The project is built using Ember-CLI and the canary versions of both ember and ember-data
